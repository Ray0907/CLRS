# Dynamic Programming

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. COnstruct an optimal solution from computed information.

### Optimal substructure varies across problem fomains in tow ways.

1. how many subproblems an optimal solution to the original problem uses.
2. how many choices we have in determining which subproblems to use in an optimal solution.

### Longest common subsequence

1. Characterizing a longest common subsequence
2. A recursive solution.
3. Computing the length of an LCS
4. Constructing an LCS
