## Starassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication
- Volker Strassen first published this algorithm in 1969 and proved that the n3 general matrix multiplication algorithm wasn't optimal. The Strassen algorithm is only slightly better than that, but its publication resulted in much more research about matrix multiplication that led to faster approaches
