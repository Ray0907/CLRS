# Sorting in linear time

## Stability in sorting algorithm

- Stability is mainly important when we have key value pairs with duplicate keys possible(like perople names as key and their details as values). And we wish to sort these by keys.
  - stable sorting : Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort etc.
  - unstable sorting: Heap Sort, Quick Sort etc.

## Counting sort

- sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

## Radix sort

- Do following for each digit i where i varies from least significant digit to the most significant digit.
  Sort input array using counting sort (or any stable sort) according to the iâ€™th digit.
