# Elementary data structures

### stacks and queues

- stack and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE operation.
- stack: the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted A.K.A **_LIFO_**
  - if we attempt to pop an empty stack, we say the stack **_underflow_**
  - if S.top exceeds n, the stack **_overflow_**
- queue: the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time. A.K.A **_FIFO_**
  - the queue has a **_head_** and **_tail_**
