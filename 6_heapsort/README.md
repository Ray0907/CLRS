# Heapsort

### heap

- There are two kinds of binary heaps:

  - max-heaps A[parent(i)] >= A[i] (the biggest element in max-heap is at the root)
  - min-heaps A[parent(i)] <= A[i] (the smallest element in max-heap is at the root)

- array start with 0 so the left node is parent *2 +1, right node is parent *2 +2
